    <h2> Marvin Canastuj </h2>
    <p> I am studying Software Development BS I decided to study this carrier because it was a dream 
        that I got since I was a child also I love computing so i thing it is a verry good oportunity 
        I have to learn. 
    </p>
    <p> What I love the most about BYU-Idaho in my short experience I feel supported and I feel that 
        is not about studying by myself I know it is inspired by God and I know He is hear to help me. </p>
    <p>I am member of the Church since I was 8 years old, My parents were member even before I borned. 
        My favorite scripture is Moroni 7:33 that said :  And Christ hath said: If ye will have faith 
        in me ye shall have power to do whatsoever thing is expedient in me. I have a personal testimony 
        of this scripture and I can say: It is true.  </p>
